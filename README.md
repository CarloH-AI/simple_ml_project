# 📊 Tourism and GDP Correlation Analysis

**Author**: Carlo Alberto Sartori
**Course**: Introduction to Coding and Data Management 2

## 📘 Overview

This project investigates the relationship between **tourism** and **GDP** across various countries. The goal is to determine whether the number of international tourist arrivals and departures has any correlation with a country's economic performance, as measured by GDP and GDP per capita. The project also analyzes the growth rates of both indicators over the past 15–20 years.

## 📂 Datasets Used

* **GDP Dataset**
  Source: [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home)
  Contains GDP, GDP per capita, and growth rate data for countries worldwide (last 20 years)

* **Tourism Arrivals Dataset**
  Source: [UNWTO](https://www.unwto.org/)
  Contains the number of international tourists arriving in each country (last 15 years)

* **Tourism Departures Dataset**
  Source: [UNWTO](https://www.unwto.org/)
  Contains the number of outbound tourists departing from each country (last 15 years)

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. **Correlation**:
   How does the number of international tourist arrivals correlate with the GDP of countries over time?

2. **Growth Rates**:
   Is there a relationship between the growth rate of arriving tourists and the GDP growth rate?

3. **Economic Differences**:
   Are there significant differences in tourism patterns (arrivals/departures) between high-GDP and low-GDP countries?

## 🛠️ Methods

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Merging datasets by country and year
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Statistical correlation analysis

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

* Visual insights into global tourism and GDP trends
* Measurable correlations between tourism flows and economic indicators
* Comparative analysis between economically diverse countries
